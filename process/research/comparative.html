  <h1> Species in Pieces </h1>
  <p> This website is an interactive exhibit for endangered animals. The opening of the site is a sleek animation of fragmented shards or
    triangles, which come together to form the first animal- The Helmeted Hornbill. The aesthetic instantly grabs you, as the shards magically
    form the animal. In the background, ambient music accompanies it with a sad tone. When you scroll up and down, it goes to the next animal,
    while the shards animate to recreate the new one. On the second page you see the Vaquita.
    <br> <br>
	Each page has links to accompany the animal so you can learn more about it. The elements are extremely simple, but impressive.
  You have the background which is a plain color that changes gradually when you scroll through each animal. The animal itself takes the foreground, and so
  the user experience is very clean and easy to understand.
  <br> <br>
	The strength of the experience comes from its simplicity yet sleek design of what it does include. The user right away know how to interact, as there are buttons
  and scrolling, with little else. The website gives a clear emotional tone of grief, while the digital shards making up each animal animate subtly to make them look
  as though they are in cages. The emotional pungency of the website, along with its sleek design, is what makes it so powerful. </p>

  <h1> Wake Up </h1>
  <p> This website takes on a completely different tone than the last one- whimsical, silly, and light. Right when the site opens,
    it says “The site is sleeping.... We Dare you to wake it up in 60 seconds”. This gives the user an immediate instruction on how to interact with the site.
    <br><br>
	What comes next is a virtual desktop with a browser window opened to a “sleeping website”. On the right are icons you can use to try to wake it up, such as
  opening the curtains, tickling it, using insects, throwing sandals, or playing music. No matter what you do, the website will find a way to ignore you and keep sleeping.
  <br><br>
	I chose this because it closely resembled my site on the surface, as the face takes up the bulk of the screen, and the user interacts with it. In my case,
  I want the face to perhaps mirror the user's emotions, rather than being a seperate entity that you are interacting with.
  <br><br>
	Compared to the Species in Pieces website, the emotional tone of this is set with brighter colors, more cartoon-like graphics, and a sillier overall concept.
  The user navigation cues are still just as strong, as it emulates a normal computer desktop. It gives the user agency to begin creatively exploring the possibilities,
  which is something I want to encourage in my website. </p>
